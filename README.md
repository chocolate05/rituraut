	PROJECT : TEXT EDITOR
	

	This text editor is a command-shell based text editor that enable user to edit, save, and view any type of file in ASCII format. The original purpose of this program is to demonstrate pointers, memory allocations/de-allocations, file input or output, and string search techniques in C. Ncurses is used to implement this text editor.

->Features of this text editor: 
	1>Edit the current line 
	2>Move one line up 
	3>Move one line down 
	4>Delete the current line 
	5>Display the contents of the buffer 
	6>Add a line after the line at which you are navigating 
	7>Save changes and exit to main menu 
	8>Exit discarding any changes 
	9>Show the list of commands
	10>Search a word
	11>Replace text
	12>Go to a specified line
	13>Copy text
	14>Paste text
	and many more

->The Structure of the Program:
	 A huge buffer is used to read from and store all the text. The buffer is written in a doubly linked- list structure, the text file is break down and represented in list of nodes. A second buffer is also used for tracking purposes for the undo feature in this illustration. Adding, replacing, deleting a line or a block involves simple iteration processes that involve O(n) complexity. Saving, reading, quitting, and undo are also bounded in the same complexity.


->Limitations of the program would be: 
	The text program only reads in ASCII format text files. Any other file would not be able to work properly with the editor.


->How to use the program? 
	After compilation, an executable would be automatically generated (default executable file name for C Programming Language is a.exe). Run the program with desired text file name in shell command line.

Check "./project -h" for more information.
The program takes a single file for opens it for editing the contents in the file.
Example: 
    ./project -h <filename>
		or
    ./project <filename>
    >> File with a filename <filename> will be created if it does not exist already.
	else it will read the file and open the file for editing.

Example:
    ./project 
    >> When no argument given, the editor asks whether to open any file or not.

->Other aspect of the program: 
	Undo is a complex operation that involves many different programming techniques in this demonstration. The operation would require a history of the command and the information the user had type. Using this information, the software tracks the amount of code that it needs to bring back or erase. One other aspect of the program is to free the allocated memory when it is no longer to be used. In Java, this is automatically done with the Javaâ€™s Garbage Collector. However, in C we will need to use Malloc () to reserve a memory space for our linked-list and use Free() when discarding the unused memories.
